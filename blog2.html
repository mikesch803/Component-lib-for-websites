        <p> What happens when we put script tag before body tag?
        </p>
        <p>It doesn't render anything. Why?</p>
        <p>
            Lets understand first default behaviour of browser. In case of default, we put script tag after body tag.
            In this scenario, browser stop rendering while JavaScript is encountered that means it downloads its files
            and then execute it. Rendering is countinued after JavaScript execution is done. Here rendering stops plus
            it
            performs slow. So its not good practice to do so.
        </p>
        <p>What are better ways or we can say standard ways of this JS loading?</p>
        <p>One is put script tag before body tag and use <span>async attribute</span> in script. In this scenario html
            renders
            while JavaScript files are download and then html stops render while JS files execution and then countinued.
        </p>

        <p>Other way is use defer attribute in place of async. In this scenario browser downloads JavaScript files while
            html
            renders, then defers execution of JavaScript until html rendering is complete that means execution occurs
            only after renders. </p>
