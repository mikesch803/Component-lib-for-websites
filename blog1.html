        <h2>A small brief information about classes and objects.</h2>
        <br>
        <small><strong>Dec 1,2020 . 11:50pm</strong> </small>
        <p> There are lots of object-oriented languages that students find difficult to understand the first time they
            read. So here short information that leads you to a better understanding of the classes and objects concept.
        </p>
        <p>In the real world, we can see many objects around us such as cars, mobile, pets, humans, etc. All
            these objects have some state and behaviour(functions). lets me take an example.</p>
        <p>
            Suppose, you would buy a new laptop then what will its states and behaviours?
        </p>
        <p>Its states would be the brand name, boot speed, battery backup and the behaviour would be like playing games,
            playing movies, sleep mode, power ON and OFF, etc.</p>

                    <p>So, here the laptop is class.</p>
            </header>

            <p> brandName -String, bootSpeed -int, batteryBackup -int. All these are states that are the field.</p>
            <p>playGame(), playMovie(), sleepMode(). All these are functions.</p>
